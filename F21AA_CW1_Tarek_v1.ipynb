       "      <th>! WARNING !  Not for those who can't handle the heat! * SAFETY INFORMATION ! WARNING! Risk of death, severe injury, chemical reactions. ------------------------------------------------------------ DO NOT even think of attempting to try a product this hot without being fully prepared. Acclimate yourself over a period of months to truly hot food substances. Keep antidotes on hand such as peanut butter, vodka, ice cream, etc. If the burning sensation is over-powering, place an antidote in your mouth and swirl it around for several minutes. Repeat as necessary. Contact a medical professional for help as needed. ----------------------------------------------------------- * OVERALL REACTION All right, with the Safety info out of the way, I will now delve into the really good news: Woo-hoo! This stuff is HOT! Spicy, yes, indeed -- and GREAT! From time to time I buy Blair's products whenever I see them in a store and now we are blessed to be able to pick them up on the Internet and right here at Amazon, too. This Death Rain Nitro powder is killer! Aaaaaahhh! HELP! Call 9-1-1 and look out! PLEASE please Please PLEASE do NOT attempt to sample any Dath Rain Nitro unless you are a 100% certified psycho Hot Head and can take the Scoville Units way, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy up there my friend. YES! If so, then take just a little bit, maybe three or four speckles of the powder, and try it on something. I just now sprinkled some on a spoon of chili that I made last night and after a few seconds, WHOAH! Tremors. Spasms. Internal tsunamis of flavor, shock, heat waves . . . now I am perspiring . . . but lovin' it! Wooooooooooooooooo! Woo-hoo! At first, you may not notice anything and think, \"Hmm. This stuff isn't so hot.\" Then, the delayed fuse reaction takes affect . . . and keeps on burning, and burning, and BURNING! Aaaaaahhhh! Ten to fifteen minutes after ingestion, the heat and your own body's reaction will reach an apex so please hang in there, be patient, wait for the results, then consider the full effect, flavor, heat, power, and other attributes of Blair's Death Rain Nitro powder seasoning. Try a little, wait a lot. This is for your own safety, ok, thanks. Wait maybe . . . five to ten minutes. Then decide what Blair's Death Rain Nitro means to you in terms of physiological as well as flavorful terms. * NO PAIN, NO GAIN You know why the hot, spicy stuff is so fabulous: the reaction to the PAIN inflicted by the whacky hydroxides from the crazy end of the pH spectrum generate endorphins as a protective response. In turn, the endorphins give us that RUSH that we so enjoy and we feel good, great, even exuberant as we pile on the spicy materials, in search of a further quest for a new high. The more we're used to the Scoville Units, the more we need to get that rush. Fortunately, no one has to worry about illegal drugs, shared needles, and all that other nonsense. * FLAVOR CRYSTALS There is a hint of that delicious, fruity habanero in there . . . but mostly, the Nitro Death Rain Seasoning has HEAT. I wouldn't want to fool ya', I wouldn't want to mislead ya' -- take heed -- this is not a food substance to play around with. It is SERIOUS stuff. The ingredients list is corn syrup, natural pepper flavor (contains soybean oil), habanero powder, ancho powder, and spices. * THE SPICE MYSTERY OK, will somebody PLEASE share with us what the mystery ingredient of \"spices\" really are? Don't you just LOVE wondering what \"spices\" could be? What is that, Blair's, come clean here. Spices could be anything in the spice rack; anything in the spice aisle at the store; anything as defined by law such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory guidelines allow. WE WANT ANSWERS! Tell us what \"spices\" are, or we're comin' for ya! * FINAL ANALYSIS I highly recommned this product for you or for any friends and family members who are bona fide Hot Heads. Enjoy! Yours in Scoville Units,   --Dennis J. O'Boyle</th>\n",

This brand of fruit was the most DISGUSTING I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to eat. As soon as my shipment arrived I opened a can and poured it into a bowl. So far so good.  Then me and my daughter ate some. We both looked at each other with an odd look. Ok, maybe the first bite is a little off. So I try another bite, yuck. I checked the side of another can to see why these peaches would taste so funny.  The ingredients state:  white peach halves, water, sugar. Packed exclusively for American Roland food Corp.  New York, NY 10010.  Product of China Peaches, water, and sugar can't possibly taste this nasty!  The texture of the liquid has an unusual viscosity to it for light syrup. This produces an odd mouth feel after the second bite, can't exactly explain it.  Something is just off. Based on the other reviews that are favorable I will give the rest of the box (11 more cans left) to the next can food collection, maybe someone else will enjoy them.

       "      <th>!!!!!!! YEAH !!!!!! This is THE best hot seasoning out there.  It's super hot and at first all you may get out of it is hot, but if you're in it for pure heat then go with the 3am special reserve from blair (basically pure, slightly diluted capsaicin). However, this powder has a great flavor of its own as well as acting like MSG by exciting all the other flavors in your food - so power through the first few applications, let your system get used to it, then everything tastes way better because of it.  I use it on everything except sweets.  People will be insulted when you want to sprinkle on their homemade dish because they don't understand that it's not like normal hotsauce; just tell them that it's exactly like their salt and pepper but more-so. The best part is no matter how much hot you are used to, you can achieve a superior sharp burn without the acid reflux side-effects of super-hotsauce (pure capsaicin actually counteracts acid reflux and ulcer problems fyi) or the intestinal problems associated with non-extracted habanero or ghost chili powder.  Or you can just get some heat and flavor - whatever you're in the mood for, Nitro will abide.  Additionally, it's much harder to get hot-eyes with Nitro than with super-hotsauces because it's a powder and doesn't stay on your hands. non-chiliheads: I suggest you go with Blair's Death Rain Habanero - great flavor without as much heat (still hot though, it's about 1/4th as hot as Nitro by weight). caution: do not fry</th>\n",

       "      <th>\" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!\" I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try \"Natural Calm\"; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot. I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because \"Natural Calm\" does the job. I've been taking \"Natural Calm\" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff. As for negatives to \"Natural Calm\"...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick. All in all 5+ stars. \"Natural Calm\" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.</th>\n",

Many people, trying to be and sound more sophisticated, substitute the words \"smoked salmon\" for the word \"lox\".  Having eaten the \"SEA BEAR SMOKED SALMON TRIO\", herein being reviewed, (and the literature that comes with it), I have learnt that, whilst all \"lox\" IS smoked salmon, not all \"smoked salmon\" is lox. (SeaBear DOES offer a nice, large package of \"lox\"....and calls it \"lox\", and illustrates it, in the advertising flyer that comes with the \"Smoked Salmon Trio\").  But the fish within the \"Smoked Salmon Trio\" is NOT \"lox\". The fish here is dryish, and very salty.  \"Lox\", on the other hand, must go through additional preparation, for it is far more moist than the dryish fish within the \"Smoked Salmon Trio\".  I have seen, (in the \"Cabelas\" catalogue), \"Lox\" described as 'buttery'....which it truly is.  For those who are interested, \"Lox\" also is usually certified kosher -- whilst the fish within the \"Smoked Salmon Trio\" is not. The smoked salmon within the \"Smoked Salmon Trio\", is, as I have said, very dry and salty.  However, all bones have been removed, (although the skin remains).  This fish also will keep on a shelf!  It need NOT be refrigerated until opened. The three types of smoked salmon within have very little taste variation to me.  Yes, there is a TINY bit of difference....but not enough to excite my taste buds.  And salmon -- right from cans, especially the top brands and varieties -- right from the supermarket or on Amazon, taste almost the same to me, at a far lesser price. The literature that comes with this set of three smoked salmon varieties is interesting and informative, as is the history of \"SeaBear\" foods, which is also given.  This company obviously takes great pride in providing good salmon and other products to its customers, and strives to be the best it can be.  I would advise them, however, to emphasize, even more, the difference between \"smoked salmon\" and \"lox\" in ALL its literature, and in the package description of ALL its products. Knowing whether \"Dry\" smoked salmon, or \"buttery\", or \"lox\"-type smoked salmon, is in a package, would be a great help to those who, like me, sometimes get their syntax and meanings confused, betwixt the two. SUMMARY:  Will NOT Buy This Product Again.  (But hopefully, the \"Lox\" they sell will be available in smaller quantities! : ),</th>\n",

I made a box of the pasta and separated it into 8 servings (so less than the suggested serving size). After eating the pasta I started to feel like I just ate a bowl of sugar. I tested myself a few times over the rest of the day (without having eaten anything else) and this pasta skyrocketed my glycemic index and knocked me out of ketosis for the first time in the last month of eating all my carbs from vegetables and nuts. My mistake wasn't googling this product before buying a six-pack, if I had, I would have found the useful information on: [...]- The point of my review is that buyer beware, this product may not work for you.</th>\n",

However, after baking my first loaf in my automatic bread machine, I was shocked to find that the bread is as soft and light as a cloud! The outer crust maintains a perfect crispiness even though the inside remains airy days after baking, assuming your family hasn't gobbled it up by then! And the fresh bread aroma filling the house as it bakes is better than any of the plug-in air fresheners that we're all guilty of buying, especially when you add cinnamon to the mix! I've only tried the white mix thus far (best if adding spices to the baking cycles) so I can't address the other varieties but have to assume they're equally tasty and aromatic.  I have baked additional loaves for family and friends and they love it too! Looking forward to receiving future shipments of this \"Slice of Heaven.\"</th>\n",

       "      <th>~  Similarly Disappointed ~ As with Mr. Carlson's review, my order was also received damaged, no less than one container leaking badly &amp; messing up all other containers up (had ordered 12 liters total). This most certainly is due to Amazon's continuing long-term practice of inadequate packing for shipping. Inflatable, lightweight, flimsy plastic bubbles packs for 3 gallons+ of juice with lots of \"slop\" packing-wise? Of course they will arrive damaged! In fairness though, the seals of the caps are very lightweight too. The expiration date on my juice was 2013, much better than Mr. Carson experienced. Have also appreciated the taste as well as the juice's truly amazing amount of vitamin C as well as the total price comparatively... but c'mon, Amazon! For years I've written to report damaged items from inadequate shipping practices, a few just this past year counting this shipment. So far as the Soursop fruit being 100 or even 10,000 times more effective than chemotherapy, my thought is that this is simply from the great amount of natural vitamin C available in the fruit/juice &amp; may be nothing more than that. One liter of this juice contains about a half dozen times the FDA's suggested adult male's necessary intake of vitamin C (about 7 times of an adult female's needs) &amp; this alone would likely be dozens of times more effective than taking dozens of times more of a synthetic vitamin C in pill form. Amazon simply must do better in packing this product for shipment as well as do much better packing many other items for shipment, though my honest opinion is that even if Amazon were to amp up their packing of this product that the flimsy outer seals on the containers may well not be adequate for shipping even then though they certainly must be better packed if Amazon has any hope of these arriving to customers undamaged. Thank you. ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ Edit, weeks later: Ordered 2 more shipments of the same with worse results. One package did not so much as make it out of Nevada it was leaking so badly &amp; undeliverable as a consequence. The other arrived as the last one had, except this time 2 of the 12 liters were leaking. Amazon used the very same totally inadequate large air bag packing in a box with lots of slop for the heavy liters of juice to crush &amp; pop, resulting in the containers getting tossed around during transit. No wonder some leak. Not UPS friendly packing for shipment. Frustrating, having written the review, even directing Amazon to it as well as expressing myself thoroughly as has been done for the better part of a decade &amp; Amazon has yet to change their packing system. Folks, the juice is very good, 4 of 5 stars. It's Amazon's continued predilection for lame packing of so many products over the years that is so unnecessary, in my estimation, 1 of 5 stars, that reduces this fine product to my rating of 2 of 5.

These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'. We have bought Walmart Store Brand &amp; these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling. Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk. These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done. Even if I have just fed my girls, if they see us eating they will have a fit. We put some puffs on their walker or high chair trays and they are Happy again. We even pour these in their play pen &amp; they don't even make a mess. At a restaurant if my girls are getting fussy, we'll keep giving them puffs and they are happy. We give them puffs while we are heating their food, if not they'll normally throw fits until we are feeding them.

I immediately went to the store and bought him Purina One Urinary Tract and that is what he has been on ever since. I will NEVER again try a different brand of cat food, that was over 4 years ago since I tried the cheaper cat food and he hasn't had a single UTI since. My cat LOVES his food, he is very picky but thankfully he loves his UTI formula. If you have a cat who gets UTI's I totally recommend giving this food a try.
